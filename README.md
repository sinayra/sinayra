# :wave: Hi there
Hello, I'm Sinayra, currently working at Formata Editora Educacional as Software Engineer. I usually have a good time in learning new technologies and I'm not afraid of stepping out of my comfort zone. I graduated in Computer Science at University of Brasilia and I've learned an important lesson with a very awesome professor: 
> Programming is not a square and limited way of thinking: since you're creating something with your hands, it's a very handmade art. You must use math and science in a creative way to really create a new solution, not just copy-paste from Stack Overflow. 
> Make this process as fun as possible.

My github is full of my small projects that I've used to learn new technologies and to just have fun programming.
